        <p>
          I am an aspiring front-end designer who loves manipulating web pages.
          I love to travel but it has been challenging running my current
          business. I am really looking foward to working on the road while
          visiting new places!
        </p>
        <p>
          I own my own business, but transitioning into a remote work lifestyle!

        <h3>Appalachian Trail</h3>
        <p>
          I have hiked almost the entire trail, and it has been an amazing
          experience. I have 500 miles left of 2,190. I would highly suggest it
          to anyone who loves the outdoors!

        <h2 class="card-title">Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want to master front-end development before continuing my education,
          but I am interested in increasing my knowledge in:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Iâ€™d like to work for a company to help clients create an impressive
          online presence or edit their current pages.
        </p>
        <h3>Travel</h3>
        <p>
          My husband and our dogs love to travel. I want to visit all 50 states.
          I have yet to go outside of the US, but that is on my list as well.
